  rationale: DID/VC provide interoperable identity binding and claim verification
    patterns suitable for agent name/page assertions.

  rationale: Signature and encryption profiles can be implemented using JOSE/COSE;
    evidence should record chosen profile and key management.

  rationale: For high assurance (AL3/AL4), privileged operations should use phishing-resistant
    authentication where feasible.

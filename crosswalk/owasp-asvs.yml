    id: ASVS Level 2
    name: Increased assurance for applications handling sensitive data / higher risk
    url: https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/
  rationale: AL3 implies stronger protection against common and targeted attacks plus
    higher-quality evidence.

    id: ASVS Level 3
    name: Highest assurance; critical applications with significant threat exposure
    url: https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/
  rationale: AL4 corresponds to high-criticality deployments where advanced verification
    depth is expected.

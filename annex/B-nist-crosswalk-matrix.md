# Annex B — NIST & SDO Crosswalk (Reference)

This annex maps ANAGB control categories to relevant NIST standards and frameworks.
It documents conceptual alignment and does not assert formal certification alignment.

| ANAGB Theme / Surface | NIST-aligned recommendation lens | Relevant NIST references |
|---|---|---|
| Verification tiers & UI signaling | Identity assurance + clear authentication/federation signaling | NIST 800-63 (Digital Identity Guidelines) family |
| Resolution & binding integrity | Risk assessment + continuous monitoring; integrity of trust dependencies | NIST SP 800-30; NIST SP 800-37 |
| Access control for discovery | Least privilege and resource-centric control | NIST SP 800-53; NIST SP 800-207 |
| Logging, audit, monitoring | Auditable security controls and detection/response | NIST SP 800-53; NIST SP 800-61; NIST CSF 2.0 |
| Privacy minimization & disclosure | Privacy risk management and PII safeguards | NIST Privacy Framework; NIST SP 800-122 |
| AI decisioning guardrails | Govern/Map/Measure/Manage AI risks | NIST AI RMF 1.0 |
| Secure development | Secure development practices for assurance evidence | NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF) |

# Annex B — NIST & SDO Crosswalk (Reference)

This annex maps ANAGB control categories to relevant NIST standards and frameworks.

It documents conceptual alignment and does not assert formal certification alignment.

| ANAGB Control Area | NIST Alignment Lens | Relevant Publications |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Verification tiers | Identity assurance levels | NIST 800-63 (Digital Identity Guidelines) |
| Security baseline | Control catalog alignment | NIST 800-53 Rev.5 |
| Zero Trust posture | Resource-centric protection | NIST 800-207 |
| Risk management | Governance & continuous monitoring | NIST 800-37, 800-30 |
| Privacy controls | Privacy risk management | NIST Privacy Framework |
| AI guardrails | AI lifecycle risk management | NIST AI RMF 1.0 |
